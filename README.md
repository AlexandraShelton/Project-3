Designed and implemented a relational database system for hotel bookings using SQL. The system included key entities such as Hotel, Room, Guest, Booking, Payment, and Service, supporting end-to-end operations from room reservations to service tracking and payments. Defined relationships between entities, ensuring data integrity and normalization. Utilized SQL to create tables, enforce constraints, and perform complex queries involving joins across multiple tables to manage bookings, guest information, room availability, and service usage.
